# Case-Study---Multi-Linear-Regression
Multi Linear Regression


Here,I have uploaded three Datasets (CSV format) and their respective R codes.

I have performed complete EDA and applied MLR for each of the Case studies.

For Every Dataset there is a Problem Statement associated with it. According to that I have built model of MLR for all datasets.

I have also tried building same models in Python. Codes are uploaded in the folder.
